### The Problem

Placeholder

### Inspirations

Before beginning this project I decided to take a look at the work other people have done on similar problems. I was mainly focused on finding the best way to design the wheels for the vehicle in order to maximize traction and speed.

During my search I discovered a design on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:467807) that was using tank treads rather than wheels. I decided that the increased surface area of the tank treads would help maximize traction, and chose to use a similar design for my project.

I also found a simple RC car project on [Howtomechatronics](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-dc-motor-control-tutorial-l298n-pwm-h-bridge/) which I occasionally used as a reference for circuitry and electric parts throughout this project.
