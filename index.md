### The Problem

### Inspirations

Before beginning this project I decided to take a look at the work other people have done on similar problems. I was mainly focused on the best way to design the wheels for the vehicle in order to maximize traction and speed.

Druing my search I discovered a design on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:467807) that was using tank treads rather than wheels. I decided that the increased surface area of the tank treads would help maximize traction, so I decided to use a similar design for my project.
