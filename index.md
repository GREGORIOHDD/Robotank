* Ultrasonic Sensor
* 3D printed Body & Treads

### The Problem

My primary goal for this project was to create a small vehicle using electrical components and 3D printed parts. I wanted to avoid buying wheels or using prebuilt kits for the project which led me to the tank-style design, as I could easily 3D print the necessary components for the treads.

An additional goal for the project was to give the vehicle basic autonomy through obstacle avoidance. Rather than creating a complex system for mapping the enviornment and keeping track of the vehicles location I opted for a simpler object avoidance approach. The vehicle will drive forward until it encounters and object in its path, and then it will turn until the path is clear and continue forward. This is comparable to the style of autonomy that modern vacuums like the Roomba use.

### Inspirations

Before beginning this project I decided to take a look at the work other people have done on similar problems. I was mainly focused on finding the best way to design the wheels for the vehicle in order to maximize traction and speed.

During my search I discovered a design on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:467807) that was using tank treads rather than wheels. I decided that the increased surface area of the tank treads would help maximize traction, and chose to use a similar design for this project. I made some slight modifications to the original design in order to fit the gears onto the body that I designed for the vehicle.

I also found a simple RC car project on [Howtomechatronics](https://howtomechatronics.com/tutorials/arduino/arduino-dc-motor-control-tutorial-l298n-pwm-h-bridge/) which I occasionally used as a reference for circuitry and electric parts throughout this project.
